# dslmodel

`dslmodel` is a robust framework designed for declarative model creation using templates and concurrent execution. Built on top of the powerful `pydantic` and `dspy` libraries, it provides developers with tools to generate dynamic models with ease and execute tasks concurrently, enhancing both productivity and code quality.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of `dslmodel` is modular and documentation-driven, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The core components include:

1. **DSLModel**: The heart of the framework, facilitating declarative model creation through templates.
2. **Context Editor**: A specialized tool for creating and managing `.context.md` files, ensuring that both human developers and AI assistants have access to essential project context.
3. **TypeScript Linter**: Validates `.context.md` files against predefined specifications, maintaining consistency and adherence to project standards.

The data flow within `dslmodel` follows a clear path:
```
User Inputs -> DSLModel Templates -> Generated Models -> Validation via TypeScript Linter
```
This streamlined process ensures that models are generated accurately and validated thoroughly before deployment.

## Development Guidelines

To maintain consistency and high code quality, adhere to the following development guidelines:

- **Coding Standards**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines to ensure readable and maintainable code.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use lowercase and underscores for all `.py` files. Classes should use `CamelCase`, and methods should use `snake_case`.
- **Type Annotations**: Utilize type annotations for all function signatures to enhance code clarity and enable static type checking.
- **Dependency Injection**: Manage dependencies using the `inject` library, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation using `.context.md` and `.contextdocs.md` files, providing context for both humans and AI assistants.
- **Version Control**: Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes to the codebase, ensuring peer reviews and maintaining code integrity.
- **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests using `pytest`, aiming for a coverage threshold of 90%.

## Business Context

`dslmodel` addresses the need for a standardized framework that bridges declarative model creation and AI-assisted development. By providing explicit codebase context through `.context.md` files, it enables AI assistants to offer more accurate and relevant code suggestions, reducing development time and minimizing errors.

### Key Features

- **Standardized Model Creation**: Facilitates the creation of dynamic models using templates, ensuring consistency across projects.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverages explicit codebase context to enhance AI-driven code suggestions and completions.
- **Concurrent Execution**: Supports the concurrent execution of tasks, optimizing performance and efficiency.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Ensures that both human developers and AI assistants have access to crucial project context.

### Target Audience

- **Developers**: Seeking a standardized and efficient framework for model-driven application development.
- **AI Assistants**: Requiring explicit project context to provide accurate and context-aware code suggestions.

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: The number of developers integrating `dslmodel` into their projects.
- **Development Time Reduction**: Measured decrease in time taken to create and validate models.
- **AI Accuracy Improvement**: Enhanced accuracy of AI-assisted code suggestions due to explicit context.

## Quality Assurance

Ensuring the reliability and performance of `dslmodel` is paramount. Our quality assurance processes include:

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Utilizing `pytest` and `factory-boy` to write extensive unit and integration tests, achieving a coverage threshold of 90%.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Monitoring model generation speed and memory usage during concurrent task execution to ensure optimal performance.
- **Continuous Integration**: Implementing GitHub Actions to automate testing, linting, and deployment processes, ensuring that all code changes meet quality standards before merging.
- **Code Reviews**: Mandating peer reviews for all pull requests to maintain code quality and foster collaborative development.

## Deployment and Operations

`dslmodel` is deployed and managed through a well-defined pipeline, ensuring seamless updates and high availability.

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Platform**: GitHub serves as the primary platform for code hosting and version control.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates the testing, linting, and deployment processes, ensuring that all code changes are validated and deployed efficiently.
3. **Staging Environment**: Documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing a user-friendly interface for accessing project documentation.
4. **Production Environment**: The `dslmodel` package is published to PyPI, making it easily accessible for installation via `pip`.

### Operational Procedures

- **Monitoring**: Utilize GitHub Actions logs and PyPI download statistics to monitor the health and usage of `dslmodel`.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update dependencies and address any security vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Support**: Provide support through GitHub Issues, enabling users to report bugs and request features.
