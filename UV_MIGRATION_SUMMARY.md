# UV Migration Summary

## Migration from Poetry to UV - Completed ✅

### What Changed

1. **Build System**
   - Replaced Poetry with UV for dependency management
   - Changed build backend from `poetry.core.masonry.api` to `hatchling.build`
   - Converted `pyproject.toml` to PEP 621 format

2. **Lock Files**
   - Removed `poetry.lock`
   - Using `uv.lock` for dependency locking

3. **Dependencies Format**
   - Converted from Poetry's `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` to standard `[project.dependencies]`
   - Converted optional dependencies to `[project.optional-dependencies]`
   - Changed caret requirements (`^`) to standard greater-than-or-equal (`>=`)

4. **Commands Updated**
   - `poetry install` → `uv sync`
   - `poetry install --with dev` → `uv sync --all-groups`
   - `poetry install -E otel` → `uv sync --extra otel`
   - `poetry add <package>` → `uv add <package>`
   - `poetry run <command>` → `uv run <command>`

5. **Files Modified**
   - `pyproject.toml` - Converted to PEP 621 format
   - `Makefile` - Updated all poetry commands to uv
   - `Dockerfile` - Updated to use uv sync
   - `README.md` - Added UV installation instructions
   - `PRODUCTION_READINESS_GUIDE.md` - Updated installation commands
   - `context/index.md` - Updated references
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Removed poetry-check hook

6. **New Files**
   - `uv.toml` - UV configuration (minimal)

### Benefits of UV

1. **Performance**: UV is significantly faster than Poetry for dependency resolution and installation
2. **Simplicity**: Uses standard PEP 621 format for `pyproject.toml`
3. **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with pip and other Python tools
4. **Caching**: Better caching mechanisms for faster subsequent installs

### Developer Workflow

```bash
# Install UV (one-time)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/dslmodel.git
cd dslmodel
uv sync --extra otel  # Install with all extras

# Run commands
uv run dsl --help
uv run pytest
uv run make test-essential

# Add new dependencies
uv add some-package
uv add --dev pytest-cov  # Add to dev dependencies

# Update dependencies
uv lock --upgrade
```

### Validation

All systems tested and working:
- ✅ CLI commands functional
- ✅ Dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ OpenTelemetry extras working
- ✅ Development tools available

### Notes

- Poetry is no longer required for this project
- The `poetry` command references have been completely removed
- All poethepoet (poe) tasks still work with `uv run poe <task>`
- The project maintains full compatibility with pip for installation
