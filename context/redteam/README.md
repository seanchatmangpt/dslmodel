# DSL Redteam Command

## Overview
The `redteam` command provides automated red team security testing and vulnerability assessment capabilities.

## Usage
```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
dsl redteam scan

# Generate and run adversarial security tests
dsl redteam adversarial

# Run automated penetration testing
dsl redteam pentest

# Simulate cryptographic attacks
dsl redteam crypto-attack

# Probe telemetry systems for security issues
dsl redteam probe-telemetry

# Run complete security assessment
dsl redteam full-assessment
```
