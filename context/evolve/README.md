# DSL Evolve Command

## Overview
The `evolve` command runs the ultimate 8020 evolution system, combining evolution, validation, and learning capabilities for continuous system improvement.

## Usage
```bash
# Run ultimate evolution cycle
dsl evolve ultimate

# Show evolution system status
dsl evolve status

# Show all merged capabilities
dsl evolve capabilities
```

## Subcommands

### ultimate
Runs the complete 8020 evolution-validation cycle:
```bash
dsl evolve ultimate
```

### status
Shows current evolution system status:
```bash
dsl evolve status
```

### capabilities
Displays all merged capabilities in the evolution system:
```bash
dsl evolve capabilities
```

- `dsl auto-evolve`: Automatic evolution with SwarmAgent integration
- `dsl evolve-worktree`: Worktree-based evolution with OTEL telemetry

## Evolution Process
1. **Analysis**: System state analysis and gap identification
2. **Decision Making**: Autonomous decision generation
3. **Execution**: Action execution and validation
4. **Learning**: Feedback integration and improvement

## Context
The evolution system implements the 80/20 principle for maximum efficiency, focusing on high-impact changes that deliver 80% of results with 20% of effort.
