## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **UnifiedEvolutionEngine Class**
```python
class UnifiedEvolutionEngine:
    """Core evolution engine combining all capabilities with 80/20 focus"""
    
    # Detects real issues (auto_evolve_cli)
    async def detect_all_issues(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
    
    # Applies improvements across all systems  
    async def apply_unified_improvements(self, issues: List[Dict], auto_apply: bool)
    
    # Complete evolution cycle
    async def run_unified_evolution_cycle(self, auto_apply: bool = False)
```

### **Capability Detection System**
```python
@dataclass
class EvolutionCapabilities:
    issue_detection: bool = False      # auto_evolve_cli
    telemetry_system: bool = False     # evolution_forge
    git_automation: bool = False       # git_auto_cli
    organizational_transform: bool = False  # transformation_cli
